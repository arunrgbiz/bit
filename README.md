doing my bit



Started on Aug 3rd 2015

Main Theme:
My simple version control for Organizing notes and references

Using Python 3.4.x

Project Overview:
Purpose: I needed a simple set of commands to organize my Files, Tag them, and search them.
I would like to maintain the meta information along with the files, and viewer - rather than in an excel file.

The Project will use limited commands and options to focus on the tasks which I have
like
- finding all the files and listing them
- tagging the files with certain comments and organizing them
- optionally use UI / because its complicated to develop first of all


Technical Overview:
I will probably use the Python 3.4.x version to build these set of commands of bit
